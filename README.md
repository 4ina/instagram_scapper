<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)




Instagram scraping. 

The reason for this is: we know that Instagram is one of the most used social platforms for blogging, content display and business promotion etc. 
Also Instagram is 
* Fun
* Social
* Friendly 
* Users on Instagram are active.

Today is a moment of marketing, freelancing and a lot of business advertising. 
Those business accounts usually order advertising from instagram blogers. 
Our project helps businesses to choose popular accounts by giving their statistics.
There are many tools and mechanisms to promote brands on Instagram such as paid advertising 
or using a pre-generated set of popular hashtags. In this regard, ​the presence and content of users’ 
comments becomes an important socio-psychological factor in the motivation to buy or use a product 
or service for customers. By analysing, we will determine which accounts will be ranked high in 
search results, based on the number of likes and comments, or followers. Content analysis of customer 
feedback can be beneficial not only for businesses but also for consumers themselves. In this regard, 
it makes it easier for users to evaluate a certain product or service before deciding whether to purchase it.

### Built With
